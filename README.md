# Linear Regression Project

In this project, I decided to use linear regression to investigate the following research question:

Does the nature and efficiency of the response to a fire incident impact the severity of the damage it causes? 

This question was chosen because of an encounter I had with fire some time ago. Thankfully, the damage
was limited to a car burning, but it took several minutes for firefighters to respond to the fire. Naturally, I
wondered if the damage of the fire could have been limited further with a stronger and more efficient response,
which led to my interest in this topic.

The dataset that I selected contained 17536 observations and 43 variables related to fire incidents in the City of Toronto
between 2014 and 2019. To answer my research question using linear regression, I performed the following steps:

- Chose my response variable and list of possible predictors
- Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed several candidate models to select an appropriate model based on a variety of factors, including:
  * How well they satisfied linear regression assumptions
  * How well they explained variation in response
  * How interpretable they were
  * How they were affected by outliers and other influential points
- Answered the research question based on the interpretation of the final model
- Presented my findings in a written report (which is in this repo)

I used the R programming language to conduct all of my analysis.
